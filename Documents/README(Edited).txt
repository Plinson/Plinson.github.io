New Readme including CSS:

I reused my code from assignment 1 and added CSS to it.

I used CSS on all three pages I created and i made different stytesheet for each page so that its not become complicated to navigate for me and also for the markers. I added padding, position element for almost every component that I used on all the three pages. In terms of flexbox and margin I only use it on the form that I made on the Hobbies.html page that I created 
I also added an animated background (I wrote the code in the body section at the top of each CSS page) so that it looks good and different form others. I use class and also Id for writing CSS. I ue the submit and reset button in the stylehobbies.css page. 

All the selectors are given below with the line number which I used in the stylehobbies.css page:

1. Universal selector: line- 1
2. Multiple Selector: line- 192
3. child selector: line- 226
4. sibling selector: line- 229
5. adjacent sibling selector: line- 236
6. attribute slector: line- 223
7. Pseudo-element selector: line- 243

Reference:

I use the following link for the animated background(gif)

New Readme including JavaScript and the purpose of the JavaScript Code:

This is in the "Hobbies Page"

Word Limit Indicator

1. This part limits the number of words that can be entered in a text input field.
2. It displays a word count indicator.
3. If the user tries to enter more than the allowed number of words, the code will truncate the input and display an alert message.

Game List Styling

1. This part allows the user to change the color of a list of game titles.
2. There are three buttons that correspond to different color options.
3. When a button is clicked, the color of all game titles on the page will change to the corresponding color.

Link Confirmation

1. This part adds a confirmation dialog when the user clicks on a link with the class "instagit".
2. If the user confirms the action, they will be redirected to the link's destination. Otherwise, nothing happens.

This is in the both "Index Page" and "About Page"

Link Confirmation

1. This part adds a confirmation dialog when the user clicks on a link with the class "instagit".
2. If the user confirms the action, they will be redirected to the link's destination. Otherwise, nothing happens.
3. The code prevents the default behavior of the link, so that the user stays on the same page until they confirm the action.
